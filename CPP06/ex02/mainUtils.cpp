**	to one of its derived classes (A, B, or C), because the Base class 
**	has a virtual method, making it a polymorphic type.
**
**	If the cast fails, dynamic_cast returns a NULL pointer, indicating 
**	that the object is not of the expected type. The function uses 
**	this behavior to check each derived class sequentially.
**	If none of the casts succeed, the final else block prints "Unknown type".

/*	identify (reference parameter):
**	Identifies the type of a reference to a Base object.
**	Since classes A, B, and C inherit from Base, this function
**	allows us to determine which derived class the Base reference
**	actually refers to.
**
**	The dynamic_cast is used to safely downcast the Base reference (p)
**	to one of its derived classes (A, B, or C). Because a reference is used,
**	if the cast fails, dynamic_cast throws a `std::exception`.
**	This is different from using a pointer, where `dynamic_cast` would return `NULL` instead.
**
**	The function handles the `std::exception` in a try-catch block.
**	Each derived class is tested sequentially: if the cast to `A&` fails, the exception
**	is caught, and a new try block tests for `B&`. If that fails, the process is repeated for `C&`.
**
**	If all three casts fail, the function catches the final exception and prints an error message,
**	indicating that the type could not be identified as `A`, `B`, or `C`.
**
**	Note: Using a reference parameter is required to distinguish this implementation
**	from the pointer-based `identify` function, as references provide different casting behavior.
